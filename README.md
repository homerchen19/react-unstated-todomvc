# React Unstated TodoMVC Example

This project mixes [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated) with [Redux TodoMVC Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).  
Rafactore `actions` and `reducers` in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to only **one** [Unstated Container](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated#container), very simple and easy to understand.

## Run the example

```
$ yarn
$ npm start
```
